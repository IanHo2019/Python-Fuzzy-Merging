# Fuzzy Merging in Python
This repository contains some data files I used to learn fuzzy merging in Python.

## gb_salaries.csv & gb_stats.csv
These two data files are from the [pro football reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/2020_roster.htm) on the Green Bay Packers' roster. They are "matched" on the player names, but there are some errors in those names.
